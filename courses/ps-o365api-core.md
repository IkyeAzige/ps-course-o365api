This course will introduce developers to the Office 365 APIs, a new set of APIs that will be constantly improved and updated by Microsoft. These APIs will be used by developers to access and interact with an enterprises' data in Office 365, specifically mail, contacts, calendar and files... but this list will grow over time. All four of the endpoints provided in the Office 365 APIs share common characteristics such as the tooling, authentication, interaction with Azure AD and discovery service. This course will serve as the starting point for all other Office 365 API courses.
