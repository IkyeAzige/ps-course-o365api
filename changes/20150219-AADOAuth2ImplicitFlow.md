2015-02-19 | Azure AD adds support for OAuth 2 Implicit Flow & releases ADAL JS
===============================================================================
Azure AD now supports the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow, announced on February 19, 2015. At the same time they announced a new authentication library, ADAL JS,  used in client-side applications for a safe & secure authentication process without the need for a server-side implementation.

See [this sample project](https://github.com/andrewconnell/sp-o365-rest/tree/master/adal-cors-client) for a demonstration using these two APIs & the associated blog post: [ADAL JS & CORS with O365 APIs (Files & SharePoint)](http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/adal-js-cors-with-o365-apis-files-sharepoint)].
